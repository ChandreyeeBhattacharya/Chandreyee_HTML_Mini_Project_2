    <h2>Baijnath Temple</h2>
    <p>Baijnath Temple (Devanagari: बैजनाथ मंदिर) is a Nagara style Hindu temple situated in a small town of Baijnath located in Kangra District, Himachal Pradesh, India, and was built in 8th Century by two local merchants named Ahuka and Manyuka. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva as Vaidyanath (Devanagari: वैद्यनाथ), ‘the Lord of physicians’.[1] According to the inscriptions on the present day Baijnath temple structure, a temple of Lord Shiva had existed before construction of present-day structure. The inner sanctum houses a Shiva lingam. Further images are carved in the walls and in niches on the exterior.</p>
    <p>The Baijnath temple redefines the Nagara style of architecture, which is highly popular in Himachal Pradesh. While the inner and outer walls of the temple boasts of exotic carving and sculptures depicting incidents of Hindu mythology, the inner sanctum houses the holy shivling. Surrounded by lush green gardens, the temple is destined to take your breath away as it overlooks the mighty snow-clad mountains while filling the air with spirituality.</p>
    <p>The temple also offers its visitors a tranquil experience in the Dhauladhar mountain ranges of Himalayas. Be it a nature lover, adventure enthusiast or a history buff, the Baijnath temple and places around it have a lot to keep the visitors hooked in the mighty Himalayas. Visit the quaint temple, located 16 km from bustling Palampur, for a truly spiritual and raw sojourn in the mountains.</p>
