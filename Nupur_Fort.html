    <h2>Nurpur Fort</h2>
    <p>Nurpur is a city and a municipal council in Kangra district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. It was formerly part of the Nurpur State since the 11th century AD. The capital of the state was at Pathankot formerly known as Paithan, now in Punjab.It got its name from wife of Mughal emperor Jahangir, Nur Jahan, when they visited Kangra (Nagarkot) after Jahangir's successful conquest of the Kangra Fort.</p>
    <p>Nurpur Fort is as beautiful as its name. It is a jewel of Himachal Pradesh and the most treasured antiquity. The well-known Brij Maharaj temple, within the fort, is devoted to Lord Krishna and it has a gorgeous black stone idol of the Lord Krishna. It was fetched from Rajasthan during reign of Raja Jagat Singh. The walls are adorned with lovely paintings from Indian mythology. All the paintings, beautiful figures, and rundown condition of the fort, but yet magnificent in itself; gives a nostalgic and mystic experience to tourists. The fort was previously known as Dhameri fort. In 1672, Moghal Emperor, Jahangir named the fort, Nurpur Fort after his beloved wife Nurjahan. Jahangir was one of the most powerful rulers and son of Jala-Ud-Din Mohamad Akbar. Nurpur fort is near Pathankot which is about 24 kilometers and also near Dharamshala which is 66 kilometer away. Nurpur Fort constructed by the Pathania Rajputs. The fort was built more than 900 years ago. It was broken due to the huge earthquake which affected this region in early 1905 A.D. the fort is very popular and the temple in its vicinity is the main attraction.</p>

    <h2>Climate:</h2>
    <p> Nurpur has a pleasant climate. The summer season is slightly higher than Himachal Pradesh's seasonal average, but the morning and evening daily weather is relatively cooler, thanks to a sustained, chilled breeze descending from the nearby snow-clad Dhauladhar mountains. During the monsoon season, there is a considerable amount of rainfall because Dharamsala, which receives second highest rainfall in India, is nearby. The winter season is very cold because of windchill from the aforementioned Dhauladhar. The temperature during the summertime rises up to 40 Â°C, but only for a few days at a time. Monsoons arrive by the end of June and remains until September. The presence of tourists peaks between October and November, largely because of the ideal weather.</p>
