    <h2>Pragpur Heritage Village</h2>
    <p>Pragpur is a village situated in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh. Lying in the shadows of Dhauladhar range,
        and developed about 3 centuries ago, the village of Pragpur along with the nearby village of Garli, is notified
        as a “Heritage Village” by a State Government notification dated 9 December 1997.</p>Pragpur was founded in the
    late 16th century by the Patials in memory of Princess Prag Dei of the Jaswan Royal family. The area of Pragpur was
    part of the principality of Jaswan whose chief, in the late 16th or early 17th century, charged a band of learned
    men, led by a Kuthiala Sood, to find a suitable place to commemorate Princess ‘Prag’ of his royal lineage.

    <p>Pragpur is an ornamental village with unchanged shops, cobblestone streets, old water tanks, mud-plastered walls
        and slate-roofed houses. The narrow streets, lined with fort-like houses, havelis and villas, are indicative of
        the area’s aged charisma. Due to its unique architecture and pristine beauty, the state government of Himachal
        Pradesh declared Pragpur as the country’s first Heritage Village in December 1997.</p>

    <p>The village is situated at the confluence of two 'khads' (seasonal water channel ) the Sehri khad and the
        Lag-Baliana khad which meet at Nakki. Hence it was called Pryagpur (pryag means the place where two water
        courses meet) which then became Pragpur. A 100-year old document in Sanskrit exists in which the principal of
        Oriental College, Lahore refers to the village as प्रयागपुर (Pryagpur). Since long the Lag-Baliana khad has been
        the source of water supply to Pragpur. Water mills also existed in Baliana.

        According to available records the Post and Telegraph Department established the Pragpur post office on 18
        February 1931.</p>

    <p>Today the name Pragpur is unnecessarily being changed to Paragpur (परागपुर). The story of a princess, Parag Dei,
        after whom the village is supposed to have been named, lacks evidence as no one has come up even with the name
        of Parag Dei's father.

        Along with Pragpur, the nearby village of Garli is a part of the Heritage Zone. The Judges Court is a resort
        built in a typical Anglo-Indian style of architecture. It stands in 12 acres of greens, and is just a short walk
        from the village core and the Taal. Apart from the Judges Court, which was built in 1918, Mr Lal has restored
        his 300-year-old ancestral house.
