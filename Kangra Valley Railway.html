    <h2>Kangra Valley Railway</h2>
    <p>The Kangra Valley Railway is a 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) gauge railway that runs from Pathankot, Punjab to Jogindernagar in Himachal Pradesh. It runs through the sub-Himalayan region of Kangra Valley and is 164 km (101.9 mi) long. The railway is part of the Firozpur division of Northern Railway. It is the longest Narrow Gauge line in India and also the longest 2 ft 6 in (762 mm) Gauge Railway in the World.</p>
    <p>Though original intent of Kangra Railway was to open up Kangra & Kullu valleys for their rich natural resources like timber as well as minerals, and surveys were also carried out in 1912 and 1914 for the same purpose. However, the prospects of such a project were not remunerative enough for the government and therefore, the idea was dropped. However, with proposed Uhl Hydropower project at Shanan, this project was again revived in the budget of 1926–1927.</p>
