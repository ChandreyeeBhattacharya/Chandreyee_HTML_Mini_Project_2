   <h1><em>Most wonderful 10 Heritage Places to visit Himachal Pradesh:</em></h1>
   <br>
   <h2>1.Pragpur Heritage Village</h2>
   <p>Pragpur is a village situated in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh. Lying in the shadows of Dhauladhar range, and developed about 3 centuries ago, the village of Pragpur along with the nearby village of Garli, is notified as a “Heritage Village” by a State Government notification dated 9 December 1997.</p><br><p>Pragpur was founded in the late 16th century by the Patials in memory of Princess Prag Dei of the Jaswan Royal family. The area of Pragpur was part of the principality of Jaswan whose chief, in the late 16th or early 17th century, charged a band of learned men, led by a Kuthiala Sood, to find a suitable place to commemorate Princess ‘Prag’ of his royal lineage.

   Pragpur is an ornamental village with unchanged shops, cobblestone streets, old water tanks, mud-plastered walls and slate-roofed houses. The narrow streets, lined with fort-like houses, havelis and villas, are indicative of the area’s aged charisma. Due to its unique architecture and pristine beauty, the state government of Himachal Pradesh declared Pragpur as the country’s first Heritage Village in December 1997.</p>

   <h2>2.Haripur Guler</h2>
   <p>Haripur is a township in Kangra district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Haripur Guler are twin townships carrying the heritage of Guler Riyasat. A river separates the two towns which further makes Pong wetland, a Ramsar Wetalnd Site, home to a large number of migratory birds in winters because of marshes and the presence of irrigated private land. On the other side of Haripur town, is Guler which has a narrow gauge railway station connected from Pathankot station to Jogindernagar station.

    Guler State was a historical princely state in district Kangra between 1405, when the state was founded, and 1813 when it was annexed by Punjab. Guler State was famous as the cradle of the Kangra paintings. Guler painting is the early phase of Kangra Kalam. About the middle of the eighteenth century some Hindu artists trained in Mughal style sought the patronage of the Rajas of Guler in the Kangra Valley. There they developed a style of painting which has a delicacy and a spirituality of feeling. The Guler artists had the colors of the dawn and the rainbow on their palette. On the hills of Haripur, there is a ruined fort which was built by Raja Hari Chand, which is the second fort built by him after Kangra (Nagarkot) Fort. The caves and some temples built by the king are still there, of great heritage and cultural importance.</p>

    <h2>3.Kangra Valley Railway</h2>
    <p>The Kangra Valley Railway lies in the sub-Himalayan region of Kangra Valley and covers a distance of 164 km (101.9 mi) from Pathankot to Jogindernagar in Himachal Pradesh. The Kangra valley railway comes under the Firozpur division of Northern Railway. The highest point on this line is at Ahju station at an elevation of 1,290 meters (4,230 ft).

        The railway line was planned in May 1926 and commissioned in 1929. The line has two tunnels, one of which is 250 ft (76 m) and the other 1,000 ft (300 m) in length. Trains on this narrow gauge line are pulled by small and less powerful engines than on a broad gauge main line, therefore steep ascents had to be avoided. But instead of expensively boring through the mountains on a straight way, a much longer right-of-way further south was chosen that allowed gentle slopes. From 1942 to 1954 there was no train service east of Nagrota.
        When the Maharana Pratap Sagar was constructed, the line had to be diverted between Jawanwala Shahr and Guler into higher grounds along the eastern shore of the new reservoir. In 1973, the section between these two stations, along with Anur, Jagatpur and Mangwal stations was abandoned, and the new alignment with several new stations opened three years later.</p>

    <h2>4.Taragarh Palace</h2>
    <p>If the Kangra fort can be termed the crown of Kangra district, the superb Taragarh Palace between Palampur and Baijnath can be called jewel in the crown. Sprawling in 15 acres, Taragarh is fabulous in its architectural grandeur and artistic taste. It was the personal summer resort of the Nawab of Bahawalpur Sir Sadiq Muhammad Khan Abbasi V. It was Built in 1931. The original name of the estate was AI Hilal meaning “The Cresent Moon” but later it was changed to Taragarh when Maharani Tara Devi, the wife of Raja Hari Singh of Kashmir acquired it in 1950. Dr. Karan Singh, who inherited the property after the demise of his mother Maharani Tara Devi in 1967 converted it into a heritage hotel in 1971.

        The interior is gorgeously decorated with family photographs and other artifacts. Here you can see Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir, his father and other family, Maharani Tara Devi’s supervising presence and Dr. Karan Singh as a little boy. It is rather interesting to re-live history of the region in the company of this illustrious family looking at you from the walls. The old flower-vases, pieces of heritage furniture, and family heirlooms give the place a distinctly royal look.
        
        It may be of interest to note that in days of yore Taragarh attracted the film people from Bombay and Jugal Kishore’s Lal Bangla was filmed in this palace. The Palace has an attractive blend of opulence and homeliness, perhaps because it has been a summer resort, and never a seat of power.</p>

    <p>The Baijnath temple has been continuously under worship ever since its construction in 1204 A.D. by two local merchants named Ahuka and Manyuka.

The present temple is a beautiful example of the early medieval north Indian temple architecture known as Nagara style of temples. The Svayambhu form of Sivalinga is enshrined in the sanctum of the temple that has five projections on each side and is surmounted with a tall curvilinear Shikhara. The entrance to sanctum is through a vestibule that has a large square Mandapa in front with two massive balconies one each in north and south.
